This code imports the discord library and creates a bot with the command prefix "!". It also sets the intents to all available intents. The bot then listens for when it is ready and prints "Its going to fart!" when it is. Finally, it creates a command called msg which takes in a userid, member, and message. If a member is not provided, the bot will attempt to find the user by their userid. If the user is found, it will send them an infinite loop of messages until stopped. If not, it will send an error message saying that it couldn't find the user.

IMPORTANT :

Some piece of code may be in French, it's up to you to make the change. I did not specify the syntax of each command because it seems logical to me. It's up to you to read the code!

Enjoy ðŸ˜€!
